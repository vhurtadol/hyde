### Populist mobilization in the Andes

In my dissertation, I aim to explain the sources of variation in the dynamics of populist mobilization. When and why does local populism reach national level politics? Does it always need to use electoral vehicles, or can it remain on the sidelines? What are the effects of populism on democratic stability? I use the cases of Peru and Bolivia to analyse dynamics of populist mobilization in Latin America over the last twenty years.

My analysis is focused on the supporters, not the leader of the populist mobilization. Contrary to traditional scholarship that has studied populism as a campaign strategy rooted in the use of populist rhetoric by a charismatic leader, my approach is focused on populism from the bottom-up. Populism, I argue, can emerge organically from the constant and collaborative interaction of individuals who self-identify as “the marginalized”. It is through the convergence of resentment that mobilization is born, and the umbrella that populist rhetoric provides is big enough to encompass the diverse range of issues that join these individuals.

The main challenge for populist mobilizations is to transcend the geographical confines of local grievances. Usually, one or two core issues drive local populist mobilization and the populist rhetoric allows for articulation among members of the same local space (district or region). However, populist rhetoric is not enough to mobilize neighboring communities and produce national level mobilization. Instead, structural factors at play can limit mobilization and maintain them local demands fragmented, or they can promote the emergence of a national populist mobilization.

My dissertation seeks to explain the emergence of populist mobilization at the local level from a bottom-up perspective, and to identify the factors that motivate or limit the advance of populism.
