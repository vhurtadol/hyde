### Populist mobilization in the Andes

In my dissertation, I aim to explain the sources of variation in the dynamics of populist mobilization. When and why does local populism reach national level politics? Does it always need to use electoral vehicles, or can it remain on the sidelines? What are the effects of populism on democratic stability? I use the cases of Peru and Bolivia to analyse dynamics of populist mobilization in Latin America over the last twenty years.

My analysis is focused on the supporters, not the leader of the populist mobilization. Contrary to traditional scholarship that has studied populism as a campaign strategy rooted in the use of populist rhetoric by a charismatic leader, my approach is focused on populism from the bottom-up. Populism, I argue, can emerge organically from the constant and collaborative interaction of individuals who self-identify as “the marginalized”. It is through the convergence of resentment that mobilization is born, and the umbrella that populist rhetoric provides is big enough to encompass the diverse range of issues that join these individuals.

The main challenge for populist mobilizations is to transcend the geographical confines of local grievances. Usually, one or two core issues drive local populist mobilization and the populist rhetoric allows for articulation among members of the same local space (district or region). However, populist rhetoric is not enough to mobilize neighboring communities and produce national level mobilization. Instead, structural factors at play can limit mobilization and maintain them local demands fragmented, or they can promote the emergence of a national populist mobilization.

My dissertation seeks to explain the emergence of populist mobilization at the local level from a bottom-up perspective, and to identify the factors that motivate or limit the advance of populism.

### Social policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic (with [Paolo Sosa](https://paolososavillagarcia.com))

The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged Latin American governments to provide not only a healthcare response, but also innovative economic and social policy to reduce the costs of social distancing and mandatory lockdown. These policies range from credit bailouts for businesses and wage subsidies to universal direct cash transfers. However, states with uneven territorial presence have struggled to effectively implement social policy throughout their territory, reducing their ability to control the pandemic. 

In this paper, we use the Peruvian case to analyse the implementation of a direct cash transfer policy targeted to poor households, named Bono COVID-19 (COVID-19 Bonus). Although the bono has been approved in April, there is extreme variation in its implementation throughout the territory. Why has this policy been so unevenly implemented? Using a multi-level model to analyse data from the Ministry of Social Development and Inclusion of Peru, we argue that the difference can be explained by previous subnational experiences with social programs. Social programs in Peru have been in place since the early 2000s, creating the required infrastructure to effectively distribute the benefits, follow-up on the beneficiaries and provide reliable information about the implementation. 

We find that territories that have been exposed to social programs over longer periods of time are more likely to effectively implement the Bono COVID-19 in Peru. Our research seeks to contribute to the study of long-term benefits of social policy on state capacity building.
